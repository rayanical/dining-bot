# dining-bot

- We propose a UMass Dining Chatbot which centralizes dining hall data and layering on personalization. Students can upload dietary constraints, set goals like weight loss or muscle gain, and log foods they’ve already eaten. In return, the chatbot generates daily meal plans with calories and nutritional facts, detects gaps in their diet, and adapts recommendations through natural conversation.
  
- The chatbot continuously learns from each user’s choices, creating a nutrition profile that grows smarter over time. It can scrape dining hall menus daily and answer questions like “Where’s the best vegan protein option today?”. Future expansions could include gamified goal tracking, sustainability-focused meal choices, or even integration with student meal plans. The result is a tool that not only improves student health and satisfaction but also improves the UMass Dining experience for all students / faculty.
